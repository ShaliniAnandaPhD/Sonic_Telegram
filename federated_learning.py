    Federated Averaging algorithm for aggregating model updates from multiple participants.

    This class implements the FederatedAveraging algorithm, which is a key component of federated learning.

    - Model updates: List of NumPy arrays of shape (num_model_parameters,)

    Data acquisition:
    - Model updates are computed by each participant based on their local data and shared with the central server
    - The central server collects the model updates from all participants

    Data size:
    - The size of the model updates depends on the number of model parameters
    - The number of participants can vary, and the algorithm accommodates different numbers of participants
